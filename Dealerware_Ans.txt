What concerns would you have from a testing perspective?
QA engineers must be aware of the exact user journeys, navigations, and outcomes, or else 
they won’t be able to create test cases that can comprehensively test the software at hand. 
Naturally, this will defeat the whole purpose of testing.

How would you go about tackling the QA for this work?
Development and testing teams must collaborate at regular intervals in the presence of the product head or managers so 
as to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Discussions at regular intervals maintain a transparent process and also 
help team members stay aligned on their deliverables. Clear goals help testers create and execute result-oriented test cases and deliver products on time.
n order to avoid missing out on critical requirements and project objectives, teams must create comprehensive documentation with specific 
project requirements in detail. Complete documentation will serve as a baseline for QA teams throughout the project lifecycle. 
It will also help QAs understand expected product outcomes and build the most relevant tests.


What sort of tests would be worth describing or worth automating?
A test case should be automated if:
The task is going to be repeated.
It’s going to save time.
The requirements, the test, or the task are low risk, stable, and unlikely to change often.
The test is subject to human error.
The test is time consuming.
The test has significant downtime between steps.
The test is repetitive.
These qualifications allow you to set standards for testing across the team and prioritize tests. This increases your chances of releasing on time.
